## Made following a tutorial with a few changes made
[Java tic tac toe game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA7tfvpkw0I&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOMhCAyywfnYLlrjiVOkdAI1)

I watched the video once and sought to reproduce it as best I could. There was a couple of times I had to come back to the video - such as when I could not get the event listener to respond to my button clicks (this was due to not including button[i].addActionListener(this)).

## Changes made:
- Improved the if statements that check if there's a winner.
- (Colour scheme, method and variable names)

## What I like about it
- I like how the buttons disable once there is a winner.
- I like that it is resizable and scales without issues.
- I like that the title bar changes to indicate whose turn it is and who the winner is.
- I like that the winning buttons change colour to green.

## How I would improve the program
There isn't a way to restart the game once it's over. I would add a GUI window asking to play again.

## What's next?
I would like to take what I have learnt from this tutorial and make a game of 'Connect Four'.
